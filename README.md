# Portfolio Website — Micah Scott

This is a small, responsive static portfolio site built from your resume. Files:

- `index.html` — main landing page
- `resume.html` — printable resume page
- `css/styles.css` — site styles
- `js/main.js` — tiny interactivity

How to preview locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click). For full URL paths, use a static file server.

Optional: serve with Python 3 simple server:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

To publish on GitHub Pages, push this repository to GitHub and enable Pages from the `main` branch.

Customizations you might want:
- Add project links or demos inside the project cards
- Replace avatar with a photo at `assets/avatar.png`
- Tweak `--accent` color in `css/styles.css`
